	Along the crest of the Santa Cruz Mountains, Castle Rock State Park embraces coast redwood, Douglas-fir, and madrone forest, most of which has been left in its wild, natural state. Steep canyons are sprinkled with unusual rock formations that are popular with rock climbers. The forest here is lush and mossy, crisscrossed by 32 miles of hiking and horseback riding trails. These trails are part of an even more extensive trail system that links the Santa Clara and San Lorenzo valleys with Castle Rock State Park, Big Basin Redwoods State Park, and the Pacific Coast.</p>

There are several labyrinths in the park that are worth exploring. In the summer it can be hot and dry, in the winter lush and green. There is excellent birding in the pine and eucalyptus forests and you&#39;re sure to spot a cow or two.</p>

	Tennessee Valley is an amazing offshoot of the Marin Headlands, with hiking trails that suit the whole family. The Tennessee Valley Trail is mostly level; it begins at the parking area and travels 1.7 miles to Tennessee Beach. For the more adventurous hiker, there are a number of other trails leading into the hills above Tennessee Valley.</p>
<div>
	With it&#39;s many trails, Tennessee Valley is well suited for the whole family. The area contains a bevy of wildlife; from mighty raptors to common swallows, the birds of the valley will keep your eyes on the skies. The skies are not the only place to view wildlife; the valley is teeming with deer, coyote, and on an occasion you might even see a bobcat.</div>

386,397,"Fort Funston","<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Fort Funston has quite a lot to offer, whether it&rsquo;s striking 200-foot sandy bluffs, or the open space for your dogs to run free and wrestle around until its heart&rsquo;s content. If you&rsquo;re not a fan of heights or dogs, you can observe the gorgeous southwest coastline and the adventurous hang gliders leaping off it, from the safety of a wooden deck that is directly in front of the parking lot.</p>
<p>
	Make sure to bring a jacket, the winds are almost constant here. Beginning on Skyline Road and walking up the narrow trail (there are a couple), you will be surrounded by sea figs. Once you get to the wider dirt path, and round the corner you will be greeted by beautiful cypress trees that, at times, make a shaded archway. Be sure to admire them for their own beauty, because when you round the corner and slowly make out the coastline, it will be hard to notice anything else. The height of the cliffs seem to amplify the splendor of the water. Glancing down at the shore, you will notice that many dogs and dog owners are enjoying that same landscape. From these cliffs, you can make it down to the beach. However, it is not wheelchair accessible and is rather steep.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;Continuing along the main path, you will see a couple of trivial run-off trails towards the cliffs. If you&rsquo;re the adventurous type, it&rsquo;s worthwhile to follow one. The private views they offer are as scary as they are stunning. Moving forward along the dirt path, you will eventually see a parking lot straight ahead, and the path will continue along the cliff. Here, there are also a couple of run-off paths that offer great views- just be careful to not get too close.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;Continuing on the main path will locate you in front of the wooden ramp and bridge that leads to one of the best look-out of the site, where you can view the stretching coastline, the sloping hillside with the houses upon it, and some adventurous hang gliders taking their chances with the wind. A very easy trail with lots of rewarding views.</p>

	Surrounded by urban development, Milagra Ridge forms what biologists call an island ecosystem. Here, wildlife is isolated from other habitats, feeding and migration corridors are compromised and exotic species can easily invade native habitat. Despite this isolation, Milagra Ridge hosts a surprising number of threatened and endangered species including Mission blue and San Bruno elfin butterflies and the California red-legged frog. Milagra&rsquo;s proximity to urban development, its limited size and its rare wildlife make it exceptionally sensitive to human disturbance. Therefore, visitors are required to stay on trails and pets must be leashed. More from NPS <a href="http://www.nps.gov/goga/miri.htm" target="_blank">here</a></p>

	Opened in 2011, this trailhead restores a long-lost access from Cole Valley neighborhood into Interior Greenbelt and Mt. Sutro Open Space Reserve. It&#39;s one of the most scenic approaches to Mt Sutro, and it&#39;s a short walk from MUNI N, 6, 37, and 43. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The Historic Trail starts up a wooden stairway then turns up a narrow garden between two old houses, before entering a dense eucalyptus forest. Soon you join an old path and climb along Woodland Creek (audible after rain) then switchback across the upper slopes. &nbsp;The sheltered forest understory has marvelous songbirds early in the morning, and numerous native plants amidst the invasive ivy and blackberry.</p>
<p>
	In about 0.4 mile is a junction with the Edgewood Trail.&nbsp;Here you can continue straight to follow the Historic Trail around the west flank of Mt. Sutro en route to the summit; or ascend sharp left on the Edgewood Trail to reach the Fairy Gates and North Ridge Trails, or descend right to Edgewood Ave.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The grade is generally easy (10%), though about 100 yards into the woods is a brief, steep (20%) stretch that can be a bit of a challenge.</p>
<p>
	The trail is multiuse, though bicyclists will need to dismount and carry their bikes on the Stanyan Street stairs.</p>

672,926,"Benicia Bridge Bike Path North - Park Road","<p>
	The north end of the Benicia Bridge bike path starts at Park Road. The path starts under the freeway ramps, and soon runs alongside the southbound traffic. A spur trail branches right, under the bridge abutment to a rudimentary vista point and parking area. (The road to the vista point parallels the bike path, separated by a chain link fence). Once on the bridge you have great views west up Carquinez Strait toward Benicia and Martinez. Noisy but kinda scenic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The bike path was proposed as far back as 1989. It was dedicated in 2009 as the route of the Bay Area Ridge Trail and San Francisco Bay Trail. These two regional trails also coincide with a planned 50-mile Carquinez Strait Scenic Loop Trail linking to the Al Zampa Bridge between Vallejo and Crockett. More info at www.ridgetrail.org and www.baytrail.org.</p>
<p>
	Park Road has not yet been dedicated by either trail organization, as it is a narrow road with narrow bike lanes. So far (2011) there is no sidewalk for pedestrians but traffic is relatively light and the bike lanes are walkable with care.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Nearest transit stops are Benicia Breeze in downtown Benicia; and County Connection at the Martinez Amtrak station. These two transit agencies don&#39;t connect in Martinez but both have routes to Pleasant Hill BART. There&#39;s also an Amtrak bus stop in the industrial parks north of Benicia.</p>

	The park&#39;s award-winning trails are recognized for their accessibility, providing visitors with an easy walk on paved trails or boardwalks through the Woods. Other trails to the ridge tops offer a more strenuous experience for avid hikers. In the light gaps beneath the redwood trees are red alders, California big leaf maples, tanoaks, and Douglas fir. The forest floor is covered in redwood sorrel, ferns, fungi, duff and debris. Several bridges cross Redwood Creek which flows through the park year-round. Wildlife residents include the endangered coho salmon fingerlings, Pacific wren, woodpeckers, owls, deer, chipmunks, skunks, river otters and squirrels to name a few.

	Surrounded by urban development, Milagra Ridge forms what biologists call an island ecosystem. Here, wildlife is isolated from other habitats, feeding and migration corridors are compromised and exotic species can easily invade native habitat. Despite this isolation, Milagra Ridge hosts a surprising number of threatened and endangered species including Mission blue and San Bruno elfin butterflies and the California red-legged frog. Milagra&rsquo;s proximity to urban development, its limited size and its rare wildlife make it exceptionally sensitive to human disturbance. Therefore, visitors are required to stay on trails and pets must be leashed. <a href="http://www.nps.gov/goga/miri.htm" target="_blank">More from NPS</a>.</p>

	A new, level section (a few hundred yards long) of smooth decomposed granite and a boardwalk are part of a restoration project and provide a reprieve from this otherwise bumpy trail.&nbsp; It meanders around a promising native plant garden (they were recently planted) and crosses a marsh. Heading west and uphill from the trail is a levee trail that separates Sharp Park Golf Course from the ocean. To the south another .5 miles is Pacifica Pier. Although this route requires careful navigation around lots of ruts and is quite bumpy, the sweeping views are worth the effort. If you combine the hilly portions, the level section and the coastal levee trail you could hike for a few miles.</p>
<p>
	For a longer hike, you could connect via a sidewalk along Hwy 1 a short distance, to Calera Creek Trail. This paved .75 mile trail runs through restored wetlands to Rockaway Beach.</p>

	If you are starting from Daly City BART, follow the directions from the start.</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		After exiting the BART station, walk south a short distance and descend into a pedestrian tunnel that will bring you to the south side of John Daly Blvd.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
		Follow John Daly Blvd across I-280, in the direction of the ocean.&nbsp; In approximately one mile, you will come to the intersection of Lake Merced Blvd, across from Westlake Mall.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
		Turn right and follow the Ridge Trail north along the east sidewalk of Lake Merced Blvd. Soon you enter San Francisco near the intersection of John Muir Drive at the south end of Lake Merced.</li>
	<li>
		Cross to the island, then west along John Muir Drive. Follow the paved hiker/bicyclist path on the west side of Lake Merced.&nbsp; The path continues along Skyline Blvd (Hwy 35), past the turn-off to Harding Park. Around the north end of Lake Merced the path swings right along Lake Merced Blvd.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
		Just before the intersection of Sunset Blvd, turn left across Lake Merced Blvd and follow the paved bike path along the west side of Sunset Blvd.</li>
	<li>
		Walk one block north to the Ocean Ave signal. Cross to the east side of Sunset Blvd and continue north on the gravel path 3 blocks until you reach Wawona St.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
		Turn right on Wawona, and walk three blocks east to 34<sup>th</sup> Avenue and the west entrance of Pine Lake Park.</li>
	<li>
		Descend the paved path to Laguna Puerca, then up the valley. (There are two paths up the valley&ndash;the original Ridge Trail route follows the right-hand road along the lawn; the left-hand path follows the edge of the forest. Either path takes you to the parking lot by Stern Grove.)</li>
	<li>
		Past the parking lot is the Stern Grove Amphitheater.&nbsp; Walk through the Amphitheater and then bear left up the hill on a path that will continue in front of the Trocadero Inn, a restored Victorian-era roadhouse.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
		Continue uphill on the paved path that includes several steep switchbacks. You will emerge from the forest onto a green lawn.</li>
	<li>
		Walk north to Wawona at 21<sup>st</sup> Ave.</li>
	<li>
		Turn right and walk one block to 20<sup>th</sup> Ave.</li>
	<li>
		Turn left and go one block along Larsen Park to Vicente.</li>
	<li>
		Turn right on Vicente and walk east about 8 blocks to West Portal Avenue.</li>
	<li>
		Take a left on West Portal Ave and follow this busy shopping street 1-block before turning right on Ulloa.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<br />
	<strong><em>Transit Alert!</em></strong><em>&nbsp; If you decide you&rsquo;ve hiked enough today, you can catch MUNI at the West Portal Metro Station at Ulloa and West Portal. Catch an in-bound K, L, M, or T train to Civic Center Station where you can transfer to BART.&nbsp; Look it up on the Transit &amp; Trails App!</em></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Follow Ulloa uphill about 3/4 of a mile.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
		At the crest of Ulloa, turn right on Sydney Way, and then left onto Portola Drive.</li>
	<li>
		Follow Portola Drive 2 blocks across Woodside Drive and then bear left onto Twin Peaks Blvd.</li>
	<li>
		In a short distance take a left on Panoramic Drive, and in 50 yards take a sharp right on to Midcrest Way.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	At this point you have two options:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		To follow the official Bay Area Ridge Trail route across the residential west side of Twin Peaks, take the next left on Cityview, right on Skyview, right on Aquavista, and a right on to Marview. Follow Marview to Palo Alto Ave.</li>
	<li>
		To follow the future official*, more scenic route, follow Midcrest to the end, then follow a path up to Twin Peaks Blvd.&nbsp; Cross the road and keep left, following paths up the ridge or valley toward the peaks. Back on Twin Peaks Blvd, you have the option of climbing one or both Twin Peaks via wooden stairways before proceeding to Christmas Tree Point, the vista point where tourists gather. &nbsp;(*The Ridge Trail Council is working with SF Rec &amp; Parks to make this this the Ridge Trail route!)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
	<li>
		However, if you&rsquo;ve climbed enough, stay right along the guard rail of Twin Peaks Blvd and traverse along the east side of the peaks, with great city views. Past the north peak, stay right to reach Christmas Tree Point.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
		When leaving Christmas Tree Point, continue around the semicircle to its end where you will be able to follow a path only a few yards in length that goes down Twin Peaks Blvd.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
		Cross over to the west side where you will be able to step over the guard rail on to another path that will go to the left of a fenced reservoir. (Watch out for poison oak in the brambles.)&nbsp; This path ends at Marview Drive, the official Ridge Trail route.</li>
	<li>
		Turn right and follow Marview to Palo Alto Ave.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Regardless of which option you chose, you are now at Marview and Palo Alto.</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Take a left and turn at the first right, which is Glenbrook.</li>
	<li>
		Walk downhill two blocks on Glenbrook, and turn right on Mountain Spring Ave.</li>
	<li>
		Walk downhill one block and turn left onto Twin Peaks Blvd.</li>
	<li>
		At Clarendon, turn right and continue downhill to Clayton.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>
		Turn left at Clayton and walk one block to 17<sup>th</sup> St.</li>
	<li>
		Cross to northeast corner of 17<sup>th</sup> Street.&nbsp; A few yards from the intersection of 17<sup>th</sup> and Clayton, walk up the concrete stairs going up from 17<sup>th</sup> Street on the left.</li>
	<li>
		When you get to the top of the stairs turn left on Upper Terrace and walk around to the staircase that is located at #480.</li>
	<li>
		Descend to Upper Terrace, turn left, and walk four blocks downhill to entrance of Buena Vista Park.</li>
	<li>
		Bear right and follow Buena Vista Ave East downhill on the periphery of the park until it intersects with Haight and Baker.</li>
	<li>
		Cross Haight and walk down Baker toward the Panhandle of Golden Gate Park.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong><em>TRANSIT ALERT!</em></strong><em> On Haight, buses #6 and #71 will take you to a BART station along Market Street.&nbsp; Look it up on the Transit &amp; Trails App!</em></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		At Baker and Fell, turn left and follow the hiker/bicyclist path on the north side of the Panhandle.</li>
	<li>
		One block from the end of the Panhandle, turn right on Shrader and walk uphill.</li>
	<li>
		Cross Fulton and then continue another 1/2 block north on Parker to McAllister.</li>
	<li>
		Turn left at McAllister and walk one block to Stanyan.</li>
	<li>
		Turn right at Stanyan, walk a few yards, and then turn left on McAllister.</li>
	<li>
		At Arguello, turn right and walk eight blocks north to the Presidio&rsquo;s Arguello Gate.</li>
	<li>
		Follow Arguello a short distance to a footpath that leaves Arguello on the left just past the north end of the parking lot of the Presidio Golf Club. The trail climbs through a cypress plantation and a sculpture called <em>Spire</em> by artist Andrew Goldsworthy.</li>
	<li>
		The Ridge Trail descends to Washington Blvd and follows it west 1-block, then angles right on Nauman Road.</li>
	<li>
		At the next corner, follow the Ridge Trail into the forest. Stay left past a spur trail to an overlook of the Golden Gate National Cemetery.</li>
	<li>
		Soon, angle left along Armatury Road; then cross Park Blvd and follow the signed Ridge Trail west into the woods again. The trail bends right to climb Rob Hill then descends along the edge of Rob Hill Group Campground.</li>
	<li>
		Turn right at the campground entrance and follow a footpath parallel to Washington and Harrison Streets.</li>
	<li>
		Turn right on one-lane Hitchcock Street just 1-block.</li>
	<li>
		Be sure to turn left alongside Building 1340, an old warehouse, and north across Kobbe St to join Greenough St.</li>
	<li>
		One block north, cross Ralston to the edge of the Fort Scott parade Ground.</li>
	<li>
		Walk left on the sidewalk in front of the old Spanish-style barracks to the end, then angle left to the corner of Lincoln and Merchant.</li>
	<li>
		Cross Lincoln at the 4-way stop sign and follow Merchant Dr toward the Golden Gate Bridge.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	The actual Ridge Trail route, just west of Merchant, is under construction until May 2012, so follow the following detour:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Follow Merchant to the bus stop next to US 101.</li>
	<li>
		Turn left down the sidewalk to the toll plaza underpass.</li>
	<li>
		Cross here and follow the left-hand sidewalk through the tunnel, to the tourist gathering area of the Golden Gate Bridge.</li>
</ul>
