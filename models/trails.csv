<p>
	Also from here you can start a short walk to Jewel Lake. &nbsp;The Wildcat Creek Trail goes for miles and ends up in Wildcat Regional Park. A favorite, relatively flat trail for runners.</p>

	Sibley is a gem of a park. Tucked up at the top of the Oakland hills, it&#39;s a small park with big views. From the top you can see Mt Tam and Mt Diablo and even further. There are several labyrinths in the park that are worth exploring. In the summer it can be hot and dry, in the winter lush and green. There is excellent birding in the pine and eucalyptus forests and you&#39;re sure to spot a cow or two.</p>

274,292,Tennessee Valley,"<p>
	Tennessee Valley is an amazing offshoot of the Marin Headlands, with hiking trails that suit the whole family. The Tennessee Valley Trail is mostly level; it begins at the parking area and travels 1.7 miles to Tennessee Beach. For the more adventurous hiker, there are a number of other trails leading into the hills above Tennessee Valley.</p>
<div>
	With it&#39;s many trails, Tennessee Valley is well suited for the whole family. The area contains a bevy of wildlife; from mighty raptors to common swallows, the birds of the valley will keep your eyes on the skies. The skies are not the only place to view wildlife; the valley is teeming with deer, coyote, and on an occasion you might even see a bobcat.</div>

Excellent views of the Windsor area can be had from several lookouts off of Westwood and Oakwood Trails. Picnic tables and benches can be found throughout the park. Foothill is popular with equestrians, and the majority of the trails in the park are available for riding.

372,397,Fort Funston,"<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Fort Funston has quite a lot to offer, whether it&rsquo;s striking 200-foot sandy bluffs, or the open space for your dogs to run free and wrestle around until its heart&rsquo;s content. If you&rsquo;re not a fan of heights or dogs, you can observe the gorgeous southwest coastline and the adventurous hang gliders leaping off it, from the safety of a wooden deck that is directly in front of the parking lot.</p>
<p>
	Make sure to bring a jacket, the winds are almost constant here. Beginning on Skyline Road and walking up the narrow trail (there are a couple), you will be surrounded by sea figs. Once you get to the wider dirt path, and round the corner you will be greeted by beautiful cypress trees that, at times, make a shaded archway. Be sure to admire them for their own beauty, because when you round the corner and slowly make out the coastline, it will be hard to notice anything else. The height of the cliffs seem to amplify the splendor of the water. Glancing down at the shore, you will notice that many dogs and dog owners are enjoying that same landscape. From these cliffs, you can make it down to the beach. However, it is not wheelchair accessible and is rather steep.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;Continuing along the main path, you will see a couple of trivial run-off trails towards the cliffs. If you&rsquo;re the adventurous type, it&rsquo;s worthwhile to follow one. The private views they offer are as scary as they are stunning. Moving forward along the dirt path, you will eventually see a parking lot straight ahead, and the path will continue along the cliff. Here, there are also a couple of run-off paths that offer great views- just be careful to not get too close.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;Continuing on the main path will locate you in front of the wooden ramp and bridge that leads to one of the best look-out of the site, where you can view the stretching coastline, the sloping hillside with the houses upon it, and some adventurous hang gliders taking their chances with the wind. A very easy trail with lots of rewarding views.</p>

378,405,Milagra Ridge,"<p>
	Surrounded by urban development, Milagra Ridge forms what biologists call an island ecosystem. Here, wildlife is isolated from other habitats, feeding and migration corridors are compromised and exotic species can easily invade native habitat. Despite this isolation, Milagra Ridge hosts a surprising number of threatened and endangered species including Mission blue and San Bruno elfin butterflies and the California red-legged frog. Milagra&rsquo;s proximity to urban development, its limited size and its rare wildlife make it exceptionally sensitive to human disturbance. Therefore, visitors are required to stay on trails and pets must be leashed. More from NPS <a href=http://www.nps.gov/goga/miri.htm"" target=""_blank"">here</a></p>",,,,,,,,

539,915,17th & Stanyan Trailhead,"<p>
	Opened in 2011, this trailhead restores a long-lost access from Cole Valley neighborhood into Interior Greenbelt and Mt. Sutro Open Space Reserve. It&#39;s one of the most scenic approaches to Mt Sutro, and it&#39;s a short walk from MUNI N, 6, 37, and 43. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The Historic Trail starts up a wooden stairway then turns up a narrow garden between two old houses, before entering a dense eucalyptus forest. Soon you join an old path and climb along Woodland Creek (audible after rain) then switchback across the upper slopes. &nbsp;The sheltered forest understory has marvelous songbirds early in the morning, and numerous native plants amidst the invasive ivy and blackberry.</p>
<p>
	In about 0.4 mile is a junction with the Edgewood Trail.&nbsp;Here you can continue straight to follow the Historic Trail around the west flank of Mt. Sutro en route to the summit; or ascend sharp left on the Edgewood Trail to reach the Fairy Gates and North Ridge Trails, or descend right to Edgewood Ave.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The grade is generally easy (10%), though about 100 yards into the woods is a brief, steep (20%) stretch that can be a bit of a challenge.</p>
<p>
	The trail is multiuse, though bicyclists will need to dismount and carry their bikes on the Stanyan Street stairs.</p>

Other trails to the ridge tops offer a more strenuous experience for avid hikers. In the light gaps beneath the redwood trees are red alders, California big leaf maples, tanoaks, and Douglas fir. The forest floor is covered in redwood sorrel, ferns, fungi, duff and debris. Several bridges cross Redwood Creek which flows through the park year-round. Wildlife residents include the endangered coho salmon fingerlings, Pacific wren, woodpeckers, owls, deer, chipmunks, skunks, river otters and squirrels to name a few.

	Surrounded by urban development, Milagra Ridge forms what biologists call an island ecosystem. Here, wildlife is isolated from other habitats, feeding and migration corridors are compromised and exotic species can easily invade native habitat. Despite this isolation, Milagra Ridge hosts a surprising number of threatened and endangered species including Mission blue and San Bruno elfin butterflies and the California red-legged frog. Milagra&rsquo;s proximity to urban development, its limited size and its rare wildlife make it exceptionally sensitive to human disturbance. Therefore, visitors are required to stay on trails and pets must be leashed. <a href=http://www.nps.gov/goga/miri.htm"" target=""_blank"">More from NPS</a>.</p>",,,,,,,,

	Mori Point consists of coastal bluffs, coastal prarie, and freshwater ponds on a 105-acre promontory that sits between Sharp Park and Rockaway beaches in Pacifica. A network of trails that course through the park mostly climb a gentle to moderate slope over bumpy terrain&ndash;quite manageable in a motorized wheelchair except for a very steep section leading to the point.</p>
<p>
	A new, level section (a few hundred yards long) of smooth decomposed granite and a boardwalk are part of a restoration project and provide a reprieve from this otherwise bumpy trail.&nbsp; It meanders around a promising native plant garden (they were recently planted) and crosses a marsh. Heading west and uphill from the trail is a levee trail that separates Sharp Park Golf Course from the ocean. To the south another .5 miles is Pacifica Pier. Although this route requires careful navigation around lots of ruts and is quite bumpy, the sweeping views are worth the effort. If you combine the hilly portions, the level section and the coastal levee trail you could hike for a few miles.</p>
<p>
	For a longer hike, you could connect via a sidewalk along Hwy 1 a short distance, to Calera Creek Trail. This paved .75 mile trail runs through restored wetlands to Rockaway Beach.</p>

605,1165,Kovar Trail to Mt. Diablo-Briones Trail via Ridge Top Trail,"<p>
	<span>Kovar, Ridge Top, and the Briones - Mt. Diablo trails are the heart of this trip from Howe Homestead Park into the western edge of Shell Ridge Park in Walnut Creek Open Space in Contra Costa County. This is a highly scenic park that blends rugged and gentle terrain, leading towards Mt. Diablo wildlands from this lesser used entrance.<br />
	<br />
	This trail covers an approximately 5 mile round trip loop: the open undulating hill views and level valley trails bring both challenging climbs and easy paths together in one venture. Views from the high Ridge Top Trail are far reaching and appealing. </span><br />
	<br />
	There is total climbing of about thirteen hundred feet with a maximum elevation around 800 feet, but up and down travel leads to the additional elevation gain total. Large sections of the uphill portions are moderate on this trip, but a few sections, particularly to the top of Ridge Top Trail, are quite steep and make this trip strenuous in part.<br />
	<br />
	Numerous trails criss-cross through this open space, and some but not all are marked.&nbsp; A detailed Shell Ridge trail map is available from the City of Walnut Creek website section that covers its open space areas, and is recommended to assist trail navigation.</p>

691,1630,Sky Oaks Entrance/Bullfrog Road,"<p>
	<strong>Bull Frog Road</strong> is one of the few trails from the Sky Oaks trailheads that is not either very steep or too narrow and rough for a wheelchair. From the park entrance, cross a pleasant oak-studded meadow to where the trail splits, and turn left (in the dry season you could take the right turn, Meadow Club Road, and skirt a golf course for about 0.7 mile to reach Bolinas Road, but that&rsquo;s not a particularly appealing walk). By going left, you&rsquo;ll take a boardwalk across a seasonal marsh, and continue another few hundred feet through riparian woods to a steep stretch that most wheelchair users won&rsquo;t want to attempt. Distance to this point is about .4 mile. If you continue, you&rsquo;ll pass a clearing where maintenance machinery is parked by piles of gravel and lumber, before reaching a parking area overlooking marshes along an arm of Alpine Lake. The map seems to show you can make a loop of this, and I have, more than once, but it&rsquo;s a mistake. Sky Oaks Road is very narrow, with no shoulder, uncomfortable to walk even though the speed limit is 15 mph.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Details: </strong>There is a fee to park; dogs are permitted on leash; bikes are not allowed on this trail. There&rsquo;s an inaccessible portapotty in the Sky Oaks entrance parking lot.</p>

	<strong>Non-motorized Small Boat Launch</strong></p>
<p>
	Tidewater Boating Center is located on the shore of the Oakland Estuary in San Leandro Bay. San Leandro Bay offers a quiet paddle with opportunities to see shorebirds and harbor seals, and if you are lucky, leopard sharks and bat rays.</p>
<p>
	From San Leandro Bay, you can head east to the more challenging boating conditions of the open waters of San Francisco Bay, and perhaps land at Crown Beach in Alameda. Paddling in the more protected Oakland Estuary, you can experience the mixture of history, industry, commercial activity, and houseboats found here, perhaps landing at Jack London Square after passing Coast Guard Island. Beyond Jack London Square you are advised to beware of ferry boats and very large commercial shipping vessels.</p>
<p>
	Tidewater Boating Center has a low float dock and&nbsp; two gangways, one of which is fully accessible. There are boat wheels available to borrow.</p>

	Information for non-motorized small boaters:</p>
<p>
	Angel Island offers spectacular views, secluded beaches, hiking and biking trails, camping, a caf&eacute;, and cultural history attractions. There are several interesting scenic destinations Water Trail users can visit around the island.</p>
<p>
	Ayala Cove is the main entrance to the island where passenger ferries land. There are 40 boat slips or 27 moorings that are available on a first-come, first-served basis (day use fee applies). Alternatively, you can land on the beach or share the designated dingy slips (entrance fee applies). Pulling boats onto the shore or seawall is permitted.</p>
<p>
	Boat slips at Ayala Cove are available on a first-come, first-served basis and are open 8:00 am to sunset. Ayala Cove also has overnight moorings that require a dinghy or drop off to reach the island. Boaters can anchor at other island shoreline locations (not at Ayala Cove) and come on-shore with a dinghy. Boaters may access the island until 10:00 pm. An overnight use fee applies. A State Park entrance fee is charged for both day-use and overnight mooring with a 7-day limit.</p>
